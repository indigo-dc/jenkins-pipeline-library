jenkins-pipeline-library: automate the SQA task
===============================================
The jenkins-pipeline-library provides an easy means to add to your Jenkins 
code pipelines (aka ``Jenkinsfiles``) additional stages that implement the
criteria defined in the `Software Quality Assurance (SQA) baseline 
<https://github.com/indigo-dc/sqa-baseline>`_.

Simplified and customized composition
  The SQA criteria is defined in a YAML configuration file, using specific
  parameters to provide the required data, thus avoiding the need of 
  learning the domain-specific language (DSL) syntax used to compose the
  Jenkinsfiles.

Dynamic creation of the pipelines
  Each SQA requirement defined in the configuration file is dinamically
  loaded as a new stage in the resultant pipeline. This process does not 
  affect the additional static stages already defined in the pipeline.

What is the SQA baseline?
-------------------------
The SQA criteria collects a comprehensive set of good practices meant to 
improve the quality of the resultant software. The criteria is governed by the
DevOps culture and covers the whole software development life cycle, from the 
code analysis and testing to its final delivery, with a particular focus on 
research software. The latest version of the SQA criteria can be found in 
`<https://indigo-dc.github.io/sqa-baseline>`_.
