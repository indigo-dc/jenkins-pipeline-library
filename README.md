## Motivation
The v2 series of the present library provide a straightforward way for software projects
to be compliant with common SQA practices.

In particular, the library provides the functionality to cover as much criteria as
possible from the Software and Service quality baselines below:

 * [A set of Common Software Quality Assurance Baseline Criteria for Research Projects](https://github.com/indigo-dc/sqa-baseline/), [online](https://indigo-dc.github.io/sqa-baseline/) available.
 * [A set of Common Service Quality Assurance Baseline Criteria for Research Projects](https://github.com/eosc-synergy/service-qa-baseline/), [online](https://eosc-synergy.github.io/service-qa-baseline/) available.


## Short intro
The SQA requirements are defined through a YAML-based configuration file that hides the
complexity of handling directly the Jenkins [Pipeline as Code's](https://www.jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/)
features. As a result, the SQA work, as defined in the YAML file `config.yml`, is
organized according to the criteria code names from the aforementioned baselines.

As an example, ``qc_style`` setting in the YAML is a direct reference to the 
``QC.Sty`` criteria in the previous software quality baseline, which establishes
the good practices that the source code shall follow in terms of style. The following
example runs [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) to check style consistency in
a Python project:

```
sqa_criteria:
  qc_style:
    container: python-test-tools
    commands:
      - flake8
```

As it can be seen in the example, the library provides the ``container`` option as a
way to specify the agent where the check will run. In the current version, the
library supports [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) as the container
orchestration tool to fire up the required set of services. In this example, the 
``python-test-tools`` is the identifier of a Docker Compose service.

## Contributing

Jenkins CI/CD pipelines are often similar in the type of actions that are
triggered. It then makes sense to have a common library for tackling them,
covering different programming languages and interfaces to software lifecycle
management tools.

Contributions are really welcome. Please check our
[contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
